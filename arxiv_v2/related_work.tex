Relational learning can be framed as the problem of inferring representations of the relational information in a sequence or collection of objects that is needed for some downstream task.

Relational learning is an area of active research and great interest.

A partial survey of work \citep{webbRelationalBottleneckInductive2024}.

A related but separate line of work is learning on graph-structured data, and the work exploring associated inductive biases~\citep{battaglia}.

The empirical success of relational architectures has so far primarily been limited to a few synthetic benchmarks of relational tasks, some of which is inspired by cognitive assessment tasks~\citep{esbn,matchtosample,predinet,etc}.
