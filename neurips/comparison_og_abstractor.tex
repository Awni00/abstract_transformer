\section{Comparison to~\citet{altabaa2024abstractors}}

\aanote{compare RCA to disRCA, discuss motivation for choices made, discuss limitations of the Abstractor framework that are addressed herer, etc.}

\aanote[inline,nomargin]{Abstractor could not be directly applied to language modeling.}

\aanote{add ablation experiments}

    \caption{Ablation of relational attention type. The solid line depicts the form of relational attention proposed in this work. The dotted line depicts RCA as proposed by \citet{altabaa2024abstractors}. We find that our relational attention mechanism performs better, whereas RCA performs no better than a Transformer.}
