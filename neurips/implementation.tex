\section{Code \& Implementation Details}

\aanote{Maybe briefly describe some of the implementational choices made in the public code. Some (pseudo)code for important operations? (e.g., einsum definition of disRCAv2). Describe the options available in public implementation (e.g., choice of symbol assignment mechanism, earlier iterations of RCA and disRCA, choice of activation function in MLP, positional encoding (RoPE, pos-emb), etc.)}

\subsection{Implementation of Disentangled RCA}

\subsection{Implementation of Symbol Assignment Mechanisms}

\subsection{Implementation of Encoder and Decoder Blocks}

\subsection{Other versions and iterations of RCA}

\subsection{Miscellaneous: MLP block, Positional Encoding, Normalization, etc.}
