We use augmentation policies learned by [AutoAugment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09501v1), described in this [Google AI Blogpost](https://research.google/blog/improving-deep-learning-performance-with-autoaugment/).

We swap out their implementation of ViT for a Dual Attention Transformer to evaluate the effect of relational inductive biases.
